\chapter{Conclusions}
The given high-dimensional musical dataset --- sampled to a size of $50k$, and processed to only hold numerical features --- had LEKM as the best performing \textit{SSC}-algorithm. The comparisons done between \textit{K-means} and LEKM show that there is no significant performance difference between the algorithm, feature-weighting did not improve the performance. Similar \textit{Purity} scores were found for both algorithms. Based on a panel of judges, any of the two algorithms could be used to produce clusters of high general quality, audio similarity and, novelty. The results indicate that the generated clusters could be used as a tool when composing new playlists based on the dataset.
