<p><em>Finding Clusters in a High-Dimensional Big Data Set</em></p>
<h4 id="3.-background/conditions">3. Background/Conditions</h4>
<p><em>Soundtrack your brand</em> offers a music streaming platform for companies . The songs you hear while shopping has a chance of being streamed from <em>Soundtrack your brand's</em>
 platform. The retail company picks characteristics e.g. Energy, Genre, 
Sound that fit their brand. This is then inputted into a machine 
learning model. The output is a playlist based on their selection.</p>
<p> <em>Soundtrack your brand's</em> streaming platform has <em>50 million</em> songs. Each song holds a multitude of attributes, not just metadata but also audio analysis.</p>
<p>Since obtaining training data is an expensive manual operation, the 
company is interested to see if it is possible to use exploratory 
clustering as an approximate labeling technique for the songs. 
Additionally, they are interested in using it to explore the music space
 and uncover interesting music themes.</p>
<p>With all these attributes and all these songs an additional task becomes to find a clustering technique that scales(<em>50 million songs</em>) and is reusable. Furthermore, an additional step is to determine an unknown <em>k</em>(amount of clusters).</p>
<p>Another thesis student will look at the UI components of the task and how to represent the themes to the end-user.</p>
<p>The project will be done at <em>Soundtrack your brand's</em> office in Stockholm.</p>
<h4 id="4.-research-question">4. Research Question</h4>
<ol>
<li>Q<a style="position: relative;" href="#FFD477D9967F4D7D81EC118679006910" id="FFD477D9967F4D7D81EC118679006910"></a>uestion
<ul>
<li>How Can We Find Clusters in a Big Dataset With High Attribute-Dimensionality That Scales and is Reusable?<ul>
<li>Traditional clustering algorithms assume <em>k</em> (the amount of clusters) is known beforehand. This is not the case for this thesis and so <em>k</em> approximation is necessary (that isn't too computationally heavy).</li>
<li><em>K-means</em> and other well known algorithms taught in courses do not scale across multiple processing nodes in a network.</li>
<li>With <em>50 million songs</em> <em>k</em> could end up being too 
large too manage. We might want to use dimensionality reduction or 
ranking the clusters to prioritize "good" clusters over bad.</li>
<li>How do we rank clusters? We can look at properties of the cluster 
such as density and distance to other clusters with e.g. the silhouette 
coefficient.</li>
<li>Different samples of attributes might lead to different <em>music themes</em> so sampling attributes could be an idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research Area<br>Unsupervised Learning, specifically clustering analysis. This will be combined with <em>Scalability</em> research, which would mean the research area would be <em>Distributed Systems</em> and general <em>Computer science</em>.
</li>
<li>Connection to Research/Development<br>See Background for the interest of the company. 
</li>
<li>Examination method  
<ol>
<li>Researching different clustering techniques, how they perform while scaling. </li>
<li>Researching <em>k</em>-approximation, how they scale.</li>
<li>Researching cluster-ranking.</li>
<li>Researching sampling methods suitable for the obtained clusters.</li>
<li>Dimensionality Reduction?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Evaluation<br>There are two ways in which the method will be examined.
<ul>
<li>One can look at the average e.g. silhouette coefficient of the clusters.</li>
<li>Songs don't follow a strict mathematical function. <em>Soundtrack your brand</em> will therefore provide me with <em>Music Experts</em>
 that will manually given samples of a cluster determine whether a 
cluster is good or not, that is, the songs of the cluster have a high 
correlation between each other(a theme).</li>
<li>Scaling can be determined by looking at how the algorithm performs on different sizes of the dataset.</li>
<li>Re-usability, check how well the clustering works with another sample of attributes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hypothesis<br>I believe that it is possible to achieve scalable 
clustering algorithm, however I do believe we'll see that what the 
algorithm deems to be a great cluster with highly correlated songs 
doesn't always prove to be so great by the experts, that is there is no 
common musical theme. But for the top clusters I think we will find some
 kind of a theme.
